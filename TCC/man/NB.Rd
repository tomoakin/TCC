\title{Sampling from negative biomial distribution}
\description{
   This methods allow sampling from Negative Binomial distribution with
   specified proportion of differentially expressed genes having
   specified level of differential expression in terms of fold change.
   The proportion of upregulated are also specified.
   The distribution of original expression levels are generated by resampling
   real data of \emph{Arabidopsis} RNA-seq data from \code{\link{arab}}.
   This function will be obsoleted. Use \link{simulateReadCounts}
   instead.
