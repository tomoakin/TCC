\title{Plot an log fold-change versus log average expression
 (so-called M-A plot)}
\description{This function generates a scatter plot of log fold-change
 (i.e., \eqn{M = \log_2 G2 - \log_2 G1}{M = log2(G2) - log2(G1)} on 
 the \eqn{y}-axis) between Groups 1 vs. 2) versus log average 
 expression (i.e., \eqn{A = (\log_2 G1 + \log_2 G2) / 2}{A = (log2(G1) + 
 log2(G2)) / 2} on the \eqn{x}-axis) using normalized count data.}

\details{
This function generates roughly three different M-A plots 
depending on the conditions for \link{TCC-class} objects. 
When the function is performed just after the \code{new} method, 
all the genes (points) are treated as non-DEGs (the default is black; see Example 1). 
The \code{\link{generateSimulationData}} function followed 
by the \code{\link{plot}} function can classify the genes as \emph{true} non-DEGs (black), 
\emph{true} DEGs up-regulated in Group 1 (G1; blue), 
and \emph{true} DEGs up-regulated in G2 (red) (see Example 2). 
The \code{\link{estimateDE}} function followed 
by the \code{\link{plot}} function generates \emph{estimated} DEGs (magenta) 
and the remaining \emph{estimated} non-DEGs (black).

Genes with normalized counts of 0 in any one group
cannot be plotted on the M-A plot because those M and A values 
cannot be calculated (as \eqn{\log 0} is undefined).  
Similar to the \code{\link[edgeR]{plotSmear}} function in edgeR package, 
\code{\link{plot}} function plots those points at the left side 
of the minimum A (i.e., log average expression) value. 
The \eqn{x} coordinate of those points is the minimum A value minus 1.
The \eqn{y} coordinate is calculated as if the 0 count was the minimum observed 
non-0 count in each group.

# 1. 
# M-A plotting just after constructing the TCC class object from
# hypoData. In this case, the plot is generated from hypoData
# that has been scaled in such a way that the library sizes of

# original hypoData. Note that all points are in black. This is
# because the information about DEG or non-DEG for each gene is 
# not indicated.

# 2-1.

# non-DEGs are in black, DEGs up-regulated in G1 and G2 are in
# blue and red.

# 2-2. 
# M-A plotting of DEGES/edgeR-normalized simulation data.

# zero.
