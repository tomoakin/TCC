This package contains methods required for the TbT method.
For comparison of tag count data, including RNA-seq and ChIP-seq
analysis, removal of differentially represented tags before normalization.
This package provides a code base to do such analysis by using
edgeR, baySeq, and DESeq packages. In addition, differential gene expression
data from Arabidopsis thaliana is taken from NBPSeq package for
simulation data generation.

edgeR and baySeq are available from bioconductor and can be installed by

biocLite("ROC")
