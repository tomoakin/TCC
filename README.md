R package for tag count comparison


Differential expression analysis for tag count data with robust normalization strategies
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package provides functions for performing differential expression 
analysis using differentially expressed gene elimination strategy. 
A simple unified interface is provided which encapsulates functions 
to calculate normalization factors and estimate differentially 
expressed genes defined in edgeR, baySeq, and DESeq packages.   
The appropriate combination provided by TCC allows a more robust 
and accurate estimation performed easily than directly using original packages. 
Functions to produce simulation data under various conditions and to plot the data are also provided.
